To see the random creature, keep the numberOfGeneration and populationSize variable in constant.py equal to one. Then run the button.py file.
To see the evolved creature, change the numberOfGeneration and populationSize to a bigger number such as 10. Then run the button.py file again.

I created a creature with 4 legs and 2 arms. The legs are meant to push the creature forward along the platform. The two side arms are meant to hold the creature onto the platform to prevent it from falling on either side. The fitness function is the xPosition minus the zPosition. We are taking the smallest value between parent and child since we want to move left
